# YOLO Nano implementation
This is my implementation of YOLO Nano with Pytorch. If you like it, please star it.

### Introduction
YOLO Nano paper:
[YOLO Nano: a Highly Compact You Only Look Once Convolutional Neural Network for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01271)




### Compared to [Faceboxes](https://g), what has been changed 


### How to run this code base
1) git clone  git@github.com:ardeal/FaceBoxes_VS2015_Python.git
2) 






### In addition
1) the model file 




### Time needed to run the code on CPU
On Windows 10, Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-2123 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 64G memory and SSD, the time needed to run:
<br>
for 640*480 input image, the time needed is around 60-70ms
<br>
for 320*240 input image, the time needed is around 20-30ms
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Output of the code
I tested a few images, and the output are followed:
